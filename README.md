# DeepFake Image Detection Using CNN

This repository hosts the implementation of a **DeepFake Image Detection** model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The project aims to distinguish between real and fake images generated by GANs, providing a robust tool to combat the spread of fake visual content. The project also includes an interactive interface built with **Streamlit** for user-friendly operation.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into the following directories:
```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── real/
│   └── fake/
├── test/
│   ├── real/
│   └── fake/
└── valid/
    ├── real/
    └── fake/
```
Images are normalized (pixel values rescaled to [0,1]) and resized to 150x150 for processing.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model comprises:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract hierarchical features using increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128).  
2. **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps with max pooling.  
3. **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with 1064 neurons and ReLU activation.  
4. **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for binary classification (Real/Fake).

### Model Summary

- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the **ImageDataGenerator** API for preprocessing. Key steps include:
1. Data augmentation (rescaling, resizing).  
2. Training for 10 epochs with batch size 100.  
3. Validation on unseen data during training.  

Results:
- Training and validation accuracy/loss are visualized after each epoch.  
- Final evaluation performed on the test dataset.
